this codebase is based on VSCode ``VEX Robotics Extension``. before you start to code, you need to do one-time setup as below. 

## set up

##### for macOS user

go to top menu ``Terminal`` -> ``New Terminal`` and type the command:

```
$ cp -r vscode_mac .vscode
```

##### for windows user

go to top menu ``Terminal`` -> ``New Terminal`` and type the command:

```
$ xcopy "vscode_win"  ".vscode"  /E /H /C /I
```


## one more step

after the above setup, you need to ``close``/``reopen`` VSCode. otherwise, you can not see ``VEX`` build buttons on the bottom menu.
